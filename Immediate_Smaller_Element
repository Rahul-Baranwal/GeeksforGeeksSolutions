//it gives the output as when the next element is smaller then it changes the value of the before element and when the next element is greater then it prints the -1 value and going towrads the lst element it always give the value -1 as there are no element next to the last


class Solution {
    void immediateSmaller(int arr[], int n) {
        // code here
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++){
            if(arr[i] > arr[i+1]){
                arr[i] = arr[i+1];
